My name is Aidan Rodts and I'm and undergraduate studying astrophysics at DePaul university. This summer I attended an REU (research experience for undergradates) at Northwestern University. Specifically this REU was done through CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Researdch in Astrophysics). As a part of this REU I attended various workshops on things like python programming, using Quest (Northwestern's computing cluster), and science communication. All of this was, of course, in addition to my research project which can be seen under the "research" tab.
